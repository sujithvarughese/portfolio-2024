export const aboutMe = "When I was younger, I remember when I first had an enlightening moment when I realized every problem could be solved if you can break them down into smaller and more manageable problems. It's much easier to correctly apply logic to solve a small problem than than trying to logically solve a problem using a macro view. Learning to code quickly intrigued my fascination in which I could do essentially just that, but for virtually any task."
